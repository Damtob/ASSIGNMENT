<p><h1>ABOUT ME</h1></p>

<p><h2>Hello, my name is Damilola Olufisayo. I am a UI/UX Designer, and a Full Stack Developer living in Lagos State Nigeria. I have a degree in mathematics from University of Ilorin.
Currently i specialize in ui/ux designs and website design, using coding or wordpress.
                </p>
                <p>Nothing bring me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the result are far from my ideal expectations. I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling.
                I've found balance between work and life, now am a totally happy person, loving mother, desirable  wife, a UI/UX designer, and a programmer, but it did'nt come easily. I have gone through hundreds of failures and complicated situations. But despite all odds, i scaled through and still learning.<br>If you have any work or project for me, or if you want to build an eye-catching website, contact me. I will make it as soon as possible.  You will really like my work, but if you don't, i will change it, until you are satisfied.</p></h2>
